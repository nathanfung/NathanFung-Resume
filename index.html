        <div class="subheading mb-5">University StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello. My name is Nathan Fung, and I am currently a second year student at the University of California, Riverside. I grew up in Orange County, California, having graduated from John F. Kennedy High School. I have obtained Honors Marks as well as AP Credits with a 3.5 Grade Point Average. I am 20 years old and currently majoring in Biochemistry but working towards transferring into Business Administration.<br><br>

        In regards to my current professional experience, I have not entered the work force yet. I have been seeking for opportunities to become employed part time while continuing my studies as a university student pursuing my Bachelor's Degree. Every day I strive to work hard as I grew up with little to nothing. My parents worked hard as immigrants in the United States in order to support me with what I needed. One day I hope to support them and take care of them just as how they did to me. In order to fulfill my goals and ambitions, I remain committed to my studies and as well as building new connections and upholding previous ones. I hope to pay back those who have supported me with what I wanted to pursue my endeavors. I am not afraid to try and experience new experiences. I am a very goal oriented and passion driven person. I will not stop or let any obstacles get in my path of reaching what I have been working towards. AFter I graduated from University of California, Riverside, I wish to pursue a Master's Degree by transferring and continuing my Master's program abroad. I am currently looking to apply to Universities in Taiwan and South Korea as I already have a few connections to those countries. After I obtain my Master's Degree, I hope to pay off my student debt as well as giving back to those who supported me along my journey. In the mean time, I plan on working part time so that I can get some real world experience and save up money.  <br><br>

        Professional experience aside, I have a few personal interests and hobbies. I like to stay up to date with current trends around the world. Ever since I was young, I grew up watching as well as playing sports with basketball being my main sport. I was lucky enough to have met a lot of people who gave me inspiration to become a better person. My coaches taught me to have hard working ethics and to never settle for less with what I wanted. I tend to put those who I consider close to me above my wants and needs. In other words, I enjoy being selfless as I put friends and family before me. Being social and relatable are just a few of the traits that I have been building myself. I look forward to establishing new connections as I continue to grow as a person. One day I hope to become a family oriented person after finding a job as a post grad, putting their interests above my wants and needs.
